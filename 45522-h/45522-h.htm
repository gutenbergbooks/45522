      Slaves were advertised as having been torn by the dogs, thus and so, on
      former occasions of flight, and large rewards were offered for the capture
      of such ingrates, dead or alive! Shall not specimens of these

      civilization?

      Some persons sneer at any distinction between hirelings of a month or year

      with <i>Sterne</i>: "Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still Slavery, still
      thou art a bitter draught; and though thousands in all ages have been made
      to drink of thee, thou art no less bitter on that account." Suppose the

      The Constitution grants neither right nor authority to interfere with the
      domestic institutions of any State; but Congress, representing the people
      and the States, has absolute control in the Territories. "More Slavery!"
      has been the continual cry of the South. Rebellion provoked the war-power
      of the President; and it is now probable that the institution which
      claimed a continent, will be numbered with the abominations that <i>were!</i>
      Let all the people say Amen.

      The evils of Slavery to the <i>white</i> race, in a material sense, are
      clearly shown by statistics; but no one can reckon the low estate of
      education, religion, and morals, especially in the country-districts of
      the South. The larger the plantations are, the wider is the space between
      the white families; and an increase of the number of slaves, is no
      increase of exalting social intercourse. The mansion cannot escape the

      The world moves, slowly it may be, but surely. Russia abolished Serfdom by
      an imperial decree, and our Republic is cutting a tangled knot by the edge
      of the sword. The loathing with which the Slave Trader has long been
      regarded, even in the South, was the index-finger of the hand of God. It
      is now a voice sounding in the darkness as a prophecy of coming day. Will
      not angels join the chorus of welcome? May the good Lord hasten the hour
      of deliverance.

      "Possibly that is true," was the reply, "but Northern ladies do not
      afterwards sell the baby!"&mdash;Besides this, it is the <i>money-interest</i>
      of Southerners to look well to the increase of their <i>property</i>,
